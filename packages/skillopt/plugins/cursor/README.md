# SkillOpt-Sleep - Cursor integration

Give Cursor an on-demand or explicitly scheduled sleep cycle: review recent
local Cursor sessions, replay recurring tasks through a selected backend, and
stage validation-gated improvements to a project Cursor skill. Nothing runs at
session end, and nothing live changes until the user adopts an accepted staged
proposal (unless they explicitly request `--auto-adopt`).

This package is a native Cursor plugin containing a command and an agent skill.
It does not install hooks or an MCP server.

## Requirements

- Cursor with plugin and agent-skill support.
- Python 3.10 or newer.
- Either a SkillOpt source checkout or an installed `skillopt-sleep` command.
- For `--backend cursor`, an installed and authenticated Cursor Agent CLI
  (`cursor-agent`). The default `mock` backend needs no provider login or spend.

The plugin and transcript harvester work on native Windows. Cursor documents
the Agent CLI for Windows through WSL; run provider-backed `--backend cursor`
inside WSL unless a native `cursor-agent` is available in your environment.

## Install the local plugin

Clone the repository, then run the installer for your platform.

macOS or Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt.git
cd SkillOpt
bash plugins/cursor/install.sh
export SKILLOPT_SLEEP_REPO="$(pwd)"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt.git
Set-Location SkillOpt
powershell -File plugins/cursor/install.ps1
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("SKILLOPT_SLEEP_REPO", "$(pwd)", "User")
```

The installer copies the plugin to
`~/.cursor/plugins/local/skillopt-sleep` (or
`%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\plugins\local\skillopt-sleep`). Quit and reopen Cursor
after changing user environment variables, then confirm that **SkillOpt-Sleep**
appears in Settings > Plugins under Installed.

The plugin and engine have separate installation boundaries. The copied plugin
teaches Cursor how to operate SkillOpt-Sleep; the engine still runs from the
source checkout through `plugins/run-sleep.sh` / `plugins/run-sleep.ps1`, or
from an installed command:

```bash
uv tool install skillopt
# or: python -m pip install skillopt
```

Use a release that includes Cursor source/backend support when choosing the
installed-command route. The source-checkout route uses the implementation in
the checkout directly.

## Use from Cursor

Run the native command, for example:

```text
/skillopt-sleep status
/skillopt-sleep dry-run --backend mock --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3
/skillopt-sleep run --backend cursor --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --progress
/skillopt-sleep adopt --legacy
```

For fan-out proposals, inspect `status` and use repeatable `--skill NAME` or
`--all-skills`. Bare adopt deliberately refuses a night containing fan-out rows.

The `skillopt-sleep` agent skill remains independently available if a Cursor
version does not surface plugin commands.

The native command's default Cursor-visible target is:

```text
.cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md
```

Use `--target-skill-path` with that value on harvest, dry-run, and run commands.
Without an explicit target, the shared engine defaults to a Claude-managed
skill, which Cursor does not load as a project skill.

### Source-checkout commands

macOS or Linux:

```bash
bash "$SKILLOPT_SLEEP_REPO/plugins/run-sleep.sh" status --project "$(pwd)"
bash "$SKILLOPT_SLEEP_REPO/plugins/run-sleep.sh" dry-run \
  --project "$(pwd)" --source cursor --backend mock \
  --target-skill-path .cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md
bash "$SKILLOPT_SLEEP_REPO/plugins/run-sleep.sh" run \
  --project "$(pwd)" --source cursor --backend cursor \
  --target-skill-path .cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md \
  --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --progress
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -File "$env:SKILLOPT_SLEEP_REPO\plugins\run-sleep.ps1" status --project "$(pwd)"
powershell -File "$env:SKILLOPT_SLEEP_REPO\plugins\run-sleep.ps1" dry-run `
  --project "$(pwd)" --source cursor --backend mock `
  --target-skill-path .cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md
powershell -File "$env:SKILLOPT_SLEEP_REPO\plugins\run-sleep.ps1" run `
  --project "$(pwd)" --source cursor --backend cursor `
  --target-skill-path .cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md `
  --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --progress
```

### Installed-command equivalents

```bash
skillopt-sleep status --project "$(pwd)"
skillopt-sleep dry-run --project "$(pwd)" --source cursor --backend mock \
  --target-skill-path .cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md
skillopt-sleep run --project "$(pwd)" --source cursor --backend cursor \
  --target-skill-path .cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md \
  --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --progress
skillopt-sleep status --project "$(pwd)"
skillopt-sleep adopt --project "$(pwd)" --legacy
```

`--source cursor` reads local JSONL transcripts below
`~/.cursor/projects/<workspace>/agent-transcripts/`. Use
`--cursor-home /path/to/.cursor` for a different Cursor home. Invoked scope
selects the current workspace; `--scope all` includes every Cursor workspace.
The source converter retains user/assistant text, tool names, and explicit turn
errors, but excludes raw tool arguments and outputs.

The first harvest uses a 72-hour lookback by default. Use
`--lookback-hours N` to choose a wider initial window, or
`--lookback-hours 0` to consider all available history while still respecting
`--max-sessions`. A successful `run`, including one that mines no tasks,
records a new harvest checkpoint. Later runs use that checkpoint instead of
the initial lookback. Use `harvest` or `dry-run` to inspect session and task
counts before the first stateful run; neither action advances the checkpoint.

`--backend cursor` invokes the authenticated Cursor Agent CLI. Use
`--cursor-path /path/to/cursor-agent` or `SKILLOPT_SLEEP_CURSOR_PATH` if it is
not on PATH, and `--model` or `SKILLOPT_SLEEP_CURSOR_MODEL` to override its
model. Check available identifiers with `cursor-agent --list-models` and verify
the billed variant in Cursor's usage reporting when cost matters. The child
process receives only an explicit runtime/authentication/locale/proxy/CA
environment allowlist; unrelated cloud and model-provider credentials are not
forwarded.

## What Cursor replay evaluates

SkillOpt reads the target skill and inserts its text into mined task prompts. It
does not invoke that file as a native Cursor skill or execute commands described
by the skill. All ordinary Cursor model calls, including mining, replay,
judging, and reflection, run in a new empty temporary workspace in read-only Ask
mode. File reads, file writes, and MCP tools are denied. `--project` selects the
transcript scope, target files, state, and staging location; it does not make the
project the Cursor Agent execution workspace.

Cursor tool-aware replay is temporarily disabled pending live Cursor
permission-boundary validation. Tasks containing a `tool_called` check fail
nonzero before Agent mode starts. The failed replay does not add a cache entry,
stage, adopt, persist state, or advance the harvest checkpoint. Use another
backend for those tasks.

This replay is useful for textual procedures, response conventions, and output
formats. It is not an end-to-end evaluation of skills that depend on repository
inspection, real CLIs, browsers, running services, or filesystem changes. There
is currently no Cursor option that enables a fresh project worktree or real
project tools. The `replay: mock` report label refers to the prompt-replay mode,
not to the selected model backend.

The shared engine also supports `mock`, `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`,
`handoff`, and `azure_openai` backends. Cursor is the native model-driven
choice for this integration; `mock` remains the no-provider default.

## Review sensitive data before provider calls

Harvesting is local and read-only, and `--backend mock` makes no provider calls.
Known secret-shaped strings are redacted from harvested Cursor content, and raw
tool payloads are excluded, but pattern-based redaction is not a guarantee.
A real backend sends truncated transcript excerpts and derived tasks to that
backend's provider for mining, replay, judging, and reflection.

Both `run` and `dry-run` perform those real-backend calls; `dry-run` prevents
staging but does not prevent provider spend. `--max-sessions` and `--max-tasks`
bound harvested work, not provider calls, tokens, elapsed time, or money. One
task can require several attempt, judge, and reflection calls. Start with small
limits and review the provider's usage reporting before increasing them.

For sensitive work, split the flow at the review boundary:

```bash
skillopt-sleep harvest --project "$(pwd)" --source cursor \
  --target-skill-path .cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md \
  --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --output reviewed-tasks.json

skillopt-sleep dry-run --project "$(pwd)" --backend cursor \
  --tasks-file reviewed-tasks.json --progress --json
```

Inspect and redact the JSON, then set its top-level `"reviewed"` field to
`true`. Real backends reject task files that remain unreviewed. Keep raw
transcripts, credentials, and task files out of commits.

## Scheduling

Runs remain user-triggered unless the user explicitly schedules them. Before
scheduling, put the Cursor source and target in
`~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json`, because the scheduler persists the project,
backend, time, and optional auto-adopt flag, but not command-line source or
target overrides:

```json
{
  "transcript_source": "cursor",
  "target_skill_path": ".cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md",
  "cursor_home": "/absolute/path/to/.cursor",
  "backend": "cursor"
}
```

Then schedule or remove the managed entry:

```bash
skillopt-sleep schedule --project "$(pwd)" --backend cursor --hour 3 --minute 17
skillopt-sleep unschedule --project "$(pwd)"
```

On Unix this uses cron; on Windows it uses Task Scheduler. Scheduled runs stage
proposals for later review by default. Do not add `--auto-adopt` unless the user
has explicitly chosen unattended adoption.

## Adoption and memory

`run` stages accepted proposals under
`<project>/.skillopt-sleep/staging/<timestamp>/`. Read the staged `report.md`
and show the held-out baseline-to-candidate score plus exact edits before
running `adopt`. Adoption backs up an existing target before replacing it.

The shared engine may also propose project `CLAUDE.md` memory updates; existing
memory behavior is unchanged. To restrict a Cursor setup to the explicit Cursor
skill, set `"evolve_memory": false` in `~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json`.

There is deliberately no session-end hook or automatic plugin execution.
