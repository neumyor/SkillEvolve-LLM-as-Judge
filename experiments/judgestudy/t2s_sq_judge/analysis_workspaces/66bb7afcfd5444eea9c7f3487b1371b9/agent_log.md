## Agent response

```
<think>The user wants to answer a Jeopardy-style question based on the provided context.
Question: "(Sarah of the Clue Crew digs in in Estonia) I'm in Estonia snacking on keele sült, an appetizer of this organ meat, sometimes known as gossip's fate"
Context mentions: "keele slt, an appetizer of this organ meat, sometimes known as gossip's fate | tongue."
So the answer is "Tongue".

Let's verify:
Context snippet: `[DOC] [TLE] jeopardy/1641_Qs.txt at master  jedoublen/jeopardy  GitHub [PAR] Too early seen unknown, and known too late!" | Juliet. right: Linda .... Sarah of the Clue Crew digs in in Estonia) I'm in Estonia snacking on ... keele slt, an appetizer of this organ meat, sometimes known as gossip's fate | tongue. right: Leah.`
Matches exactly.
Answer: Tongue.
Format: [answer]Tongue[/answer]
Check constraints: concise, inside tags. Done. 
Proceed. 
Output matches requirement. 
Final Answer: [answer]Tongue[/answer]
Done. 
Self-Correction/Verification during thought:
Is there any other possibility? "gossip's fate" -> tongue (as in "loose tongue" or "tongue-lashing"? Actually, "gossip's fate" might refer to the tongue being cut out or just the organ itself). The text explicitly says `| tongue.` after the clue. So it's definitely Tongue.
Ready. 
Output matches. 
Proceeds.
