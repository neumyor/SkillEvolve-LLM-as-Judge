The question asks for the "north African group". The text says "African Moors" or "Moors".
I will answer "Moors".
Check format: [answer]Moors[/answer]
Done. 
Let's double check. "The Visigoth Empire went out of business in 711 when it was defeated by this north African group in Spain" -> Moors.
Matches perfectly.
Proceed. 
Output matches requirement.
[answer]Moors[/answer]
Done. 
Self-Correction/Verification during thought:
Could it be "Umayyad"? The text says "In 711, troops mostly formed by Moors from North Africa led the Umayyad..." but the direct match for "north African group" is Moors.
Also, the prompt says "this north African group", which strongly points to "Moors".
I'll stick with Moors.
Final answer: Moors.
