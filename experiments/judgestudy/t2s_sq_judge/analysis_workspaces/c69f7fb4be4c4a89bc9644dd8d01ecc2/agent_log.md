The question asks for "this city's Sabres". The city is Buffalo.
Let's verify: "NHL teams that have moved to new, luxury box-filled arenas include the Boston Bruins & this city's Sabres" -> Buffalo.
The answer should be just the city name: Buffalo.
Check context for exact wording if possible, but "Buffalo" is clearly the city.
I will output [answer]Buffalo[/answer].
Done. 
Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the question: asking for the city of the Sabres that moved to a new luxury box-filled arena alongside the Boston Bruins.
